### Enhanced JavaScript - The Poughkeepsie Pushers
***

#### Objective
Maintain an active roster for the intramural baseball team, The Poughkeepsie Pushers.

#### Steps Taken
My primary focus was to implement the functionality of a simple program successfully. My aim was to allow an administrator to add/edit/delete a team member, and I wanted users to be able to view details about all the players on the team.

Using Angular 2, I wanted to manage a database (via Firebase) and successfully manipulate that data, while also displaying it live on the site using Observables.

Here is project repo [The Poughkeepsie Pushers](https://github.com/maxobaxo/js-poughkeepsie-pushers).

#### The Result
While the first version of this program works, in future versions I would like to implement a user-authentication feature, which would isolate admin permissions to users with admin login info. I would especially like to give logins with tailored permissions to each player, so that they can edit their own information, but not edit info for anyone else.

I'm excited about successfully using angular/typescript syntax in a <select> box to create a drop-down option for each player in the database on the message board's form for adding a new message.
