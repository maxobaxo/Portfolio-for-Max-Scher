# Selected Projects by Max Scher

I love developing graceful solutions to technical challenges. I believe coding is a true craftsman's trade; it requires diligence, patience, and unceasing passion for continuous learning and improvement. I have learned the majority of my coding skills from [Epicodus](www.epicodus.com), with supplemental tutorials through Free Code Camp, Codecademy, and Treehouse.
